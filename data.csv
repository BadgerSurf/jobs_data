1015 Test Rig chased the offending cable on test rig have marked where it goes into a junction box just by the oil arm, have left the lid off the junction box and marked yellow crosses around there is some damage to the cable further back as it goes around a corner again have left the cable visible for you to see, all power is on but the rig has lost comms refer to Walts log as I agree with him Mr Hart is required, hopes this helps have a good weekend.
